# thinkpad-tech-tree-tall

`thinkpad-tech-tree-tall.txt` is a plaintext map of all ThinkPad-brand laptops and tablets sold by IBM and Lenovo from 2005 to the present year. It differs from the other project, [thinkpad-tech-tree](https://github.com/Monkeyfume/thinkpad-tech-tree), in that this file's width is only 105 characters, so it can be more easily viewed in certain programs that wrap long lines of text by default, such as GNU nano or Vim. It was inspired by the ["tech trees"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_tree) found in some games.

You may notice that this file includes a significant number of spaces. If you want to edit it, I recommend using a text editor that can convert between spaces and tabs, such as Notepad++.

At some point, I want to try to fit `thinkpad-tech-tree-tall.txt` into a standard 80 columns, so that it can really be viewed on... everything.
