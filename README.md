# thinkpad-tech-tree-tall

`thinkpad-tech-tree-tall.txt` is a plaintext map of all ThinkPad-brand laptops and tablets sold by IBM and Lenovo from 2005 to the present year. It differs from the other project, [thinkpad-tech-tree](https://github.com/Monkeyfume/thinkpad-tech-tree), in that this file's width is only 105 characters, so it can be more easily viewed in certain programs that wrap long lines of text by default, such as GNU nano or Vim. It was inspired by the ["tech trees"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_tree) found in some games.

You may notice that this file includes a significant number of spaces. Spaces need to be used instead of tabs to keep compatibility between various editors and viewers, but they do make it annoying to edit something like this. My preferred text editor on Windows is Notepad++; Notepad++ has a feature where all spaces can be converted to tabs and vice versa, which makes it much easier to edit this file in particular. If you want to submit a contribution to this file, I highly recommend editing it with Notepad++ or some other program that can switch between spaces and tabs.

At some point, I want to try to fit `thinkpad-tech-tree-tall.txt` into a standard 80 columns, so that it can really be viewed on... everything.
